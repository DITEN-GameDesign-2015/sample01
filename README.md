**NOTE: maps are committed with no precomputed lighting.** To re-build lighting open the map, then World Settings > Lightmass > unset Force No Precomputed Lighting, then Build.

**NOTE**: The "_Starter Content_" package has been added to `.gitignore` as it is automatically added by UE4 on load, so don't modify its content as changes will go lost.

Actors:
- player character;
- collectible bonuses;
- exploding traps.
